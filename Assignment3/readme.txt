I ran out of time do to the following things:
	my block q doesn't consider priorities. Therefore, once on the blocked q, it is a fair game.
	my input is somewhat buggy when it refers to message.
	could not implements comments to explain code in all areas.
	code can definetly use refactoring.( repeated code in one function and then in another)

I implemented an additional '!' command to exit the program just like that for ease of use.

Hopefully you can understand what is happening with my print statements and uniquely named variables.
